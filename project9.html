      <h2>General Solidworks solid and draft.</h2>
      <p>In this project, I created a general part in SolidWorks, focusing on both the design and drafting stages. The process began with conceptualizing and modeling the part using SolidWorksâ€™ 3D design tools. I carefully defined the part's geometry, incorporating key features such as holes, fillets, and chamfers to meet specific functional requirements.

        Once the design was complete, I generated a detailed 2D draft of the part. This draft included all necessary dimensions, views, and annotations to accurately convey the design intent. GD&T symbols were applied where necessary to specify tolerances and ensure that the part could be manufactured to precise standards. The final draft served as a comprehensive guide for the production process, ensuring that the part could be fabricated accurately and efficiently.</p>
